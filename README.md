## Operation Clearout I \(Incomplete but Cool Game so Far\)


</div>

### Description

It's basically a game about a US soldier in Afganistan fighting taliban and

you must complete mission objectives to pass the levels.

It's like Duke Nukem 1 but doesn't use DirectX instead Bitblt, Very slow FPS

on PIII 200Mhz

unless compiled with certain settings, read the top of form1 to see how to

compile it this way (Professional Edition Required).

Please VOTE for it and leave comments.

NOTE: This code isn't learning material, more of a demostration to a

non-DirectX Platform Game.

Read the help form or click help to get the game's key commands.
